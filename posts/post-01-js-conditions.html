    <article class="mt-4 text-left mb-3">
      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>

      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
      
      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br>HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as "img"  and "input"  ./directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as "p"surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

     <h2 class="blogtitle">JS Functions</h2>
    <article class="mt-4 text-left mb-3"> JS functions are known also as methods and are used to perform certain actions. It is a block of code which only runs when it is called. We can pass data, known as parameters, into a method. A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses ().<br> Depending on whether a method is defined by the user, or available in the standard library, there are two types of methods in Java:Standard Library Methods and User-defined Methods. Here is an example of  Standart Library Method:
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code>public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
      
        // using the sqrt() method
        System.out.print("Square root of 4 is: " + Math.sqrt(4));
       }
       }
      </code>
      </pre>
